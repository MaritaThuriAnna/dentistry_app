# Dentist Dashboard

## Overview
**Live Deployment:** [Dentist Dashboard on Vercel](https://dentistry-app-one.vercel.app/)

The **Dentist Dashboard** is a web-based platform designed to help dentists manage their patients, appointments, and medical records efficiently. This project is developed as part of my **bachelor's thesis** and focuses on integrating a **machine learning algorithm for caries detection**, providing an AI-powered diagnostic tool for dental professionals.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login system for doctors and patients.
- **Patient Management:** Store and manage patient information.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Book and manage appointments.
- **X-Ray Upload & Analysis:** Upload patient X-ray images.
- **Caries Detection (Machine Learning):** AI-based detection of dental caries from X-ray images.
- **Patient Portal:** Patients can log in to access their medical records, view past diagnoses, and check upcoming appointments.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktops and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot
- **Database:** MySQL / Firebase
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch for caries detection
- **Styling:** CSS (Poppins font, custom styles)

### How It Works:

1. Dentist **uploads an X-ray image**.
2. The image is **processed and analyzed** by the AI model.
3. **Predictions are displayed** with a confidence score.

## Patient Portal

The **patient dashboard** allows users to:

- **View their medical records** including past diagnoses and treatments.
- **Check upcoming appointments** with their assigned dentist.
- **Receive AI-assisted caries detection results** and follow-up recommendations.
- **Communicate with their dentist** via a secure messaging system (future feature).
